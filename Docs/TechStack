The doc should be added to your ‘docs’ folder on github.

Our team decide to use react framework as front-end, flask framework as back-end, and MongoDB as database for our project. 

For front-end, we decide to use react framework instead of others like Angular.js because React.js is the most popular javascript library for now 
and is easy to learn, and poweful. To be more specific, we can use react.js to make our development progress easier due to its reusable components. 
React.js is a good fit for us to develop a extendable, flexible web app. Additionally, it has advantage for server rendering : it can show webpage on server before 
sending webpage to web browser, such that allow user to visit webpage faster. 

For back-end, we decide to use flask framework, a micro web framework written in python,  for our implementation of back-end. 
One reason for use flask is that all members know python syntax, and flask framework is lightweight, flexible for development. 
And it is very easy to use and understand with strong documentation. 
On the other hand, other python based framework like Django may also be a good choice, however, since Django follows MVC, we think it sometimes is too common 
for large projects and feels bloated for smaller projects like ours.

For database, we decide to use MongoDB instead of MySQl is that we think it is more convinient to use a NoSQL document-oriented database program to deal with 
complex relationships among data comparing relational database. What is more, MongoDB has advantages like simplicity, easy installation and settup, stong documentation, etc.
